<h1>HTML5 & CSS3 for Real World</h1>
<ul>
	<li>meta not closing</li>
	<li>link not closing</li>
	<li>avoid redundant boolean values</li>
	<li>Divide a page in 5 categories
		<ul>
			<li>Header with logo and title</li>
			<li>navigation bar</li>
			<li>body into columns</li>
			<li>article/content and ad blocks within columns</li>
			<li>footer - author and copyright info.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>header</strong> element - any chunk of content that needs its own header. Multiple header allowed.</li>
	<li><strong>section</strong> element - thematic grouping of content, typically with heading. <mark>Ex: About page: company history, mission statement and its team, lengthy "terms of service" or online new site: sports, world affair and economics. Nestable</mark></li>
	<li><strong>article</strong> element - single piece of content that can stand on its own. When in doubt, use <mark>test of syndication</mark>: if a piece of content can be republished on another site without being modified, or if it can be pushed out as an update via RSS, or on social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook, it has the makings of an article. <mark>Ex: forum post, magazine or news article, blog entry or comment blog or article</mark></li>
	<li><strong>nav</strong> element - use where ever you would use class="nav"</li>
	<li><strong>aside</strong> element - aside content should stand own its own but still should be part of a larger whole. Ex: secondary list of links, block of advertising. <mark>It's not defined by the position on the page but content itself, and its realtion to the other elements.</mark></li>
	<li><strong>footer</strong> element - footer for the section of the content of its nearest ancestor. Not defined by its position but by content. Ex: copyright information, lists of related links, author information, and similar information that you normally think of as coming at the end of a block of content. <mark>information about the author of a blog post might be displayed above the post instead of below it</mark></li>
